Needs to be planned anew. Next steps should be the following:
1. conceptual planning
   - how should the game look like in the end?
     a) actual way of playing the game
     b) visual representation
     c) features
   - how can this be roughly implemented?
   - what extra knowledge needs to be researched in order to model the application?
3. modelling the whole application on paper or by UML etc.
   - figuring out approach (functional or class based)
   - mapping out each method's functionality and return
4. writing tests for each method before actual programming begins

Only then should the actual programming proceed.
